            Our environment is currently being plagued with all sorts of tragedies: climate change, rising sea levels,
            ozone layer depletion and so on. However, very few individuals are aware of what these effects could have
            on the diversity of marine life over the next few years.

            This exhibition in particular focuses on the effects that pollution has on marine biodiversity. The images
            were put together with both Figma and Adobe Illustrator and a digital 3D model was built alongside it in
            SketchUp. The placards are made of acrylic and a section of the wall has an interactive feature where there
            is a button that visitors can press which pushes air bubbles upwards, making the trash in the water float.
            The placard which says 'Marini Biodiversity' is filled with colorful sand and the image on the floor is made
            from vinyl.
