            OREO is one of the most recognizable cookie brands in America if not the whole world. The OREO cookie
            comes in many flavours and sizes. Sometimes they're covered in chocolate, come in the form of an
            ice cream, and have even been adapted into drinks. At the end of the day, it all comes down to the original
            humble cookie: white cream sandwiched by two charcoal colored disks.

        </li>

        <li class="oreo-objective-2">
            Since OREO is an existing brand, it was necessary to follow their brand style guides: the font and color to
            use, how the cookie can be oriented, what wording is appropriate, and so on and so forth. This project began
            with a storyboard in Figma so there could be a proper roadmap for the animation. All assets of this project
            were made in Figma and the animation was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GSAP. The phrases 'OREO
            COOKIES JUST WANNA DUNK' and 'Wonderfilled' were used to stay in line with the brand's playful and inviting
            tone.
