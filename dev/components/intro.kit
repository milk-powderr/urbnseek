            <li class="paragraph11">I'm a Graphic Design Senior at Drexel's University Westphal College of
                Media Arts & Design. I'm in the process of achieving my B.Sc. and will be graduating in
                June 2024. I am open to exploring different areas in design although I am particularly
                interested in marketing, branding, packaging and user interface. I believe that a well-thought-out
                design can be the turning point of any brand.</li>

                games and collecting merchandise. I love white chocolate and I'm also an amateur
