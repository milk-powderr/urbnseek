            'AUGMENT' is a verb which mean 'to make greater, more numerous, larger, or more intense'. In this
            context, it's in relation to cutlery since the kind of cutlery used can elevate the gastronomical
            experience. This brand produces different cutlery sets based on different ocassions or themes suc
            as New Years Day, Independence Day, graduation, housewarming, etc.

            The series for this project in particular is the 'gift' series named 'Iris', which mean 'rainbow'
            in Ancient Greek. This name was chosen based on the iridescent appearance of the cutlery. The
            colored band that runs around the package would have a different color based on the theme of
            the cutlery set. The outside of the packaging as a sleek/minimal appearance to create a balance
            with the busier interior of the package. The utensils are tied down with black elastic bands
            to prevent them from shifting about and the pattern repeated on the interior is made known on the
            sides of the exterior of the package.
