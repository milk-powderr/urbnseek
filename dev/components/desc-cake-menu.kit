            A feature like a menu bar is essential to programs such as applications and websites, but they
            can become so much more when character is given to them.

        <li class="cake-menu-objective-2">
            I decided to create a menu bar for an application belonging to a pastry store. I chose to
            design it to look like a square-shaped cake that had the layers exposed. The three berries
            falling from the top add an interesting feature to the design. All elements were made in Figma
            and the animation was done with code.
