            The aim of this project was to depict the steps taken to make a cake in a machine assembly
            fashion. This project was inspired by the game 'Purble Place', a computer game where you can
            bake and deliver a cake on a conveyor belt. The instructions on the map were made to be
            easily digestible while having a playful tone.
