            A feature like a toggle switch is essential to programs such as applications and websites, but they
            can become so much more when character is given to them.

        <li class="bbread-objective-2">
            I decided to create a toggle switch that resembled a baking hot cross bun. The bun goes through
            the motion of being baked to represent the 'on/off' function. All elements were made in Figma
            and the animation was done with code.
